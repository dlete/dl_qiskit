[QuIC, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)](https://www.rri.res.in/quic/qcommconcepts.php#:~:text=The%20BB84%20protocol%20uses%20the,uses%20such%20four%20polarization%20states), explains BB84 in one paragraph. Very good synthesis.


[ACM, Quantum Key Distribution: Basic Protocols and Threats](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3575879.3576022). To spend time and attention, it is detailed.

[NSA, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Cryptography (QC)](https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/Quantum-Key-Distribution-QKD-and-Quantum-Cryptography-QC/). Oh!! it makes so much sense from an implementation point of view!!
